                                        form.
                                    </p>
                                    <p><strong>“Body”</strong> is the claim of knowing what you are – divine spiritual beings having a human experience and the “o” icon is colored orange and represents the fire of life within.</p>
                                    <p><strong>“Mind”</strong> is a claim to know who you are – holding you powerful in the identity of who you truly are. The “i” person is you and colored blue to represent the purity of water as you bathe in your own true
                                        being.
                                    </p>
                                    <p><strong>“Business”</strong> is a claim to know how you serve – you in your full expression. The “u” icon is a brown boot representing your feet on the ground – grounded in the truth and worthiness of your service.</p>
                                    <p>The purple flower icon represents the air and breath confirming our right to be free and joyful. Five petals ensure that in the game of "he loves me/she loves me not" you will always win. Combined, these four elements
                                        represent the balance we can create to live a fulfilling life.</p>

                                    <p>We plucked <em>'a whole new way of being'</em> from the ethers and it stuck. Over 7,000 miles, the inspired content simply tumbled forth and as we developed our website, we defined our business offerings and created

                                        but it sure feels good -- like the warmth of the sun on your face, the sound of nature buzzing, a whisper of a breeze and the contentment of just being in the moment and doing whatever feels inspired.</p>
                                    <p>The background represents the hues of the sun as it traverses the daytime sky overlaid on a backdrop photo that changes according to the location of the Dame Ranch. The content is minimal and wrapped in suns representing
                                        the empowerment of morning, the zenith of full-expression at mid-day and the contentment and fulfillment as the sun sets. </p>

                                                R" on its side. While the lazy R may look “’lazy” it is offering a glimpse of moving at the pace of love defying external and social expectations of a modern world. The sun rays emanating from the hump of
                                                the R inspired the rest of the design work but at its core it is an invitation to be and to know that we are at our highest service when we are creating at the pace of love.</p>
                                            <p>The bees were added to further evoke the comfort of a lazy summer day and to draw the reader’s eye down the page. Each of the suns describes a way of being and using bees became a play on the word “be” or “bee”.</p>
