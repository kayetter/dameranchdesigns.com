                            <p>The content and website design was developed through a co-creative partnership and a divinely inspired way of being at <em>Dame Ranch Designs</em>. See below for a peak at the inspiration behind the website. </p>

                              <p> <a href="https://bodymindbusiness.com" title='bodymindbusiness.com'>BodyMindBusiness</a> logo reflects the intentions of its service with icons and colors that symbolize the elements and forms of life in its most divine form.</p>
                              <p><strong>“Body”</strong> is the claim of knowing what you are – divine spiritual beings having a human experience and the “o” icon is colored orange and represents the fire of life within.</p>
                              <p><strong>“Mind”</strong> is a claim to know who you are – holding you powerful in the identity of who you truly are. The “i” person is you and colored blue to represent the purity of water as you bathe in your own true being.</p>
                              <p><strong>“Business”</strong> is a claim to know how you serve – you in your full expression. The “u” icon is a brown boot representing your feet on the ground – grounded in the truth and worthiness of your service.</p>
                              <p>The purple flower icon represents the air and breath confirming our right to be free and joyful. Combined, these four elements represent the balance we can create to live a fulfilling life.</p>

                                  Developing the content for BodyMindBusiness was a magical experience. We knew that <a href="https://bodymindbusiness.com" title='bodymindbusiness.com'>bodymindbusiness.com</a> needed a complete overhaul but we had yet to define our new business offering. We simply knew that we needed to make ourselves available to those who were seeking us. </p>
                                  <p>We plucked <em>'a whole new way of being'</em> from the ethers and it stuck. Over 7,000 miles, the inspired content simply tumbled forth and as we developed our website, we defined our business offerings and created a whole new way of being for ourselves -- divinely inspired with totally authentic tummy tickle expression.</p>

Working at the pace of love does not need to be slow but it sure feels good -- like the warmth of the sun on your face, the sound of nature buzzing, a whisper of a breeze and the contentment of just being in the moment and doing whatever feels inspired.</p>
                          <p>The background represents the hues of the sun as it traverses the daytime sky overlaid on a backdrop photo that changes according to the location of the Dame Ranch. The content is minimal and wrapped in suns representing the empowerment of morning, the zenith of full-expression at mid-day and the contentment and fulfillment as the sun sets. </p>

                              <p><a href="https://dameranchdesigns.com" title='dameranchdesigns.com'>Dame Ranch Designs</a> was borne out of whimsy and free flow frequency. The logo in the form of a traditional ranch cattle brand has a "Lazy R" on its side. While the lazy R may look “’lazy” it is offering a glimpse of moving at the pace of love defying external and social expectations of a modern world. The sun rays emanating from the hump of the R inspired the rest of the design work but at its core it is an invitation to be and to know that we are at our highest service when we are creating at the pace of love.</p>
                              <p>The bees were added to further evoke the comfort of a lazy summer day and to draw the reader’s eye down the page. Each of the suns describes a way of being and using bees became a play on the word “be” or “bee”.</p>
