                            <p>The content and website design was developed through a co-creative partnership and a divinely inspired way of being at <em>Dame Ranch Designs</em>. See below for a peak at the inspiration behind the website. </p>

                              <p> <a href="https://bodymindbusiness.com" title='bodymindbusiness.com'>BodyMindBusiness</a> logo reflects the intentions of its service with icons and colors that symbolize the elements and forms of life in its most divine form.</p>
                              <p><strong>“Body”</strong> is the claim of knowing what you are – divine spiritual beings having a human experience and the “o” icon is colored orange and represents the fire of life within.</p>
                              <p><strong>“Mind”</strong> is a claim to know who you are – holding you powerful in the identity of who you truly are. The “i” person is you and colored blue to represent the purity of water as you bathe in your own true being.</p>
                              <p><strong>“Business”</strong> is a claim to know how you serve – you in your full expression. The “u” icon is a brown boot representing your feet on the ground – grounded in the truth and worthiness of your service.</p>
                              <p>The purple flower icon represents the air and breath confirming our right to be free and joyful. Combined, these four elements represent the balance we can create to live a fulfilling life.</p>

                                  Developing the content for BodyMindBusiness was a magical experience. We knew that <a href="https://bodymindbusiness.com" title='bodymindbusiness.com'>bodymindbusiness.com</a> needed a complete overhaul but we had yet to define our new business offering. We simply knew that we needed to make ourselves available to those who were seeking us. </p>
                                  <p>We plucked <em>'a whole new way of being'</em> from the ethers and it stuck. Over 7,000 miles, the inspired content simply tumbled forth and as we developed our website, we defined our business offerings and created a whole new way of being for ourselves -- divinely inspired with totally authentic tummy tickle expression.</p>
