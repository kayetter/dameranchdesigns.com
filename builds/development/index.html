          <h2>Our Design Philosophy</h2>
          <h3>A whole new way of being … on the internet.</h3>
          <p>Everything we do at the Dame Ranch including our designs is created at the pace of love. Does this sound slow to you? It doesn’t have to be. </p>
          <p>Working at the pace of love and being in service to the vibration of love can take us many places – and sometimes much faster than we expected. What it does mean is that there isn’t costly rework or detours that lead nowhere because everything
              that is created is divinely inspired – simply and elegantly. You can be fully satisfied with the final product if you chose to be but don’t choose anything just yet. We only ask that you enjoy the process and help us help you find that tummy-tickle
              inspirational feeling that makes life fun.</p>
          <p>We are not designing and building a website for you without your participation. Your website is a portal to who you are and a channel for you and the world to celebrate you in your full expression and freedom.</p>
          <p> Whether you are seeking a website for your business, an upcoming event or just pleasure, you have already invested a piece of yourself in these endeavors and we want you to realize how magnificent, worthy and outstanding that investment is. At           dameranchdesigns, we insist that your website reflects your brilliance and we aim to assist you in creating a style that is unique and worthy of you. You are the chief designer and this is your creation. We are your co-creators because this is what we do when we are in our full tummy-tickle inspiration. We are inspired by you.</p>
          <h3>Ok, this sounds hard and you are unsure if you have the energy for something so…creative?</h3>
          <p> It doesn’t have to be hard or complicated. In fact, it can be a magical process where you meet new people, discover new things about yourself or your business and find new inspiration. We know that from this experience you will be energized and complete; ready to take on whatever is next. You may just discover a whole new way of being and get a really cool website too.</p>
          <h3>Getting started</h3>
          <p>If you think you want a new way of being … on the internet, contact us. We would love to hear from you, to listen to your story and your vision. We will respond and set up a time to meet with you. We do not require you to subscribe, we do not keep your contact information on a mailing list, there are no newsletters, upsales or commitments. There is just a conversation to see if you are as excited as we are.</p>
