                          <p>Everything we do at the Dame Ranch including our designs is created at the pace of love. Does this sound slow to you? It doesn’t have to be.</p>
                          <p>Working at the pace of love and being in service to the vibration of love can take us many places – and sometimes much faster than we expected. What it does mean is that there isn’t costly rework or detours that lead nowhere
                              because everything that is created is divinely inspired – simply and elegantly. You can be fully satisfied with the final product if you chose to be but don’t choose anything just yet. We only ask that you enjoy the process
                              and help us help you find that tummy-tickle inspirational feeling that makes life fun. <a href="" rel='modal:close'>close here</a></p>
