                            <p>Everything we do at the Dame Ranch including our designs is created at the pace of love. Does this sound slow to you? It doesn’t have to be.</p>
                            <p>Working at the pace of love and being in service to the vibration of love can take us many places – and sometimes much faster than we expected. What it does mean is that there isn’t costly rework or detours that lead nowhere
                                because everything that is created is divinely inspired – simply and elegantly. You can be fully satisfied with the final product if you chose to be but don’t choose anything just yet. We only ask that you enjoy the process
                                and help us help you find that tummy-tickle inspirational feeling that makes life fun.</p>

            <h2>Claim of Worth <br>(How We Charge)</h2>
            <h3>How much does a whole new way of being on the internet cost?</h3>
            <p>At <em class='drd'>dameranchdesigns.com</em> we believe that when you exchange money you are exchanging energy. When you contract for our services we want this exchange to be of the highest energy available for the highest good of our clients
                and ourselves and to be an equal exchange of energy. Claiming a new way of being is an investment made by <em>YOU</em>, through <em>YOU</em> and unique to <em>YOU</em> and requires an energetic investment equal and worthy of your expression
                and creative drive. We will simply match what you are willing to invest.</p>
            <p>This may seem confusing to you at first and requires a bit of explanation. There are two layers to any transaction.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>The actual exchange of goods or services for currency or compensation </strong>and,</li>
                <li><strong>The energetic exchange between the two parties</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>The buyer is satisfied with a transaction when she feels she received value that was commensurate with the dollars she paid. And the seller is satisfied with a transaction when he feels like he was paid adequately given the value of his product.
                When both parties are happy, there is an equal exchange of energy. A mismatch of energy can lead to dissatisfaction for one or both parties and can create stress, anger, frustration, shame, resentment, fear and remorse.</p>
            <p>You will not be able to claim your newly inspired way of being in alignment with your true full expression from a transaction originating from low level energy like shame and fear. And we will not be able to find our tummy-tickle inspiration
                in helping you remember your divine purpose when we have agreed to something that is partnered with stress or resentment.</p>
            <p>We do not sell an out-of-the-box, ready-to-wear program. We consider ourselves co-creators in agreement with you and the transformation you are seeking is created through our exchange. As such, it is essential that we start out on the right
                foot and that we agree to match energies from the start. I ask you again, <em>How much is it worth to you to claim a whole new way of being and to remember how you serve in your full expression?</em> </p>
            <p>The first step in your transformation is to initiate a conversation with one of us at BodyMindBusiness and this is completely free. We want to hear about you, your thoughts, desires, ideas and inspiration. We want to determine if you are a
                good fit for us and for you to decide if we are a good fit for you. We don’t ask you to subscribe to anything, buy a membership or sign-up for a program. We will not keep your contact information for a mailing list. All conversations are
                confidential.
            </p>
            <p>If we are all in agreement to continue this relationship, we will ask you to sign a <strong>Claim of Understanding</strong>. As part of this understanding, we will ask you to create a proposal for compensation. There is no template for this
                proposal. It is completely up to you and all options are considered. We simply ask that you consult with your knowing and ask yourself how much this transformation is worth to you and what are you willing to invest. If you are unsure at
                first and feel like you can only make a minimal investment, we completely understand. Please propose a compensation solution that feels right and truthful for you.</p>
            <p>The compensation proposal does not need to be completed prior to your first consultation or coaching session and can be flexible and modified at any time if it is in the highest good of you and BodyMindBusiness. BodyMindBusiness simply matches
                the investment you are willing to make if we are in alignment with your truth. We reserve the right to decline your proposal, renegotiate and/or dissolve the relationship if we are not aligned with your energetic investment and we determine
                that it is not in our highest good at the time. We do not judge, we do not evaluate based on the highest bidder. Our purpose is to find that tummy-tickle, awesomely-inspired, fantastically juicy free flow frequency that arises from helping
                you or your team transform to a new way of being and remember what truly divine, creative, unique and worthy beings we all are.</p>
            <p>We are very curious to meet you and to hear your story! Please <a href="form.php">Contact us today</a>
